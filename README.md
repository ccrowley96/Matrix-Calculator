# Matrix-Calculator
###Java matrix calculator made by Cory Crowley###

##Methods:##

###Constructors:###
*Constructor to create a matrix given m and n
*Constructor to read a matrix from a user using terminal or popups 
*Constructor to read a matrix from a .mat file. The file starts with the size of the matrix using two integers (m and n) separated by a comma. 
###Getters###
*int getN() : Getters methods for n.
*int getM() : Getters methods for m.
*double get(int i, int j) : A method to get the value stored in i and j entry of the matrix
###Operations:###
*Matrix add(Matrix m) : Add this matrix to matrix m and return the result
*Matrix subtract(Matrix m) : Subtract matrix m from  this matrix and return the result
*Matrix multiply(Matrix m) : Matrix multiplication between this matrix and matrix m. Return the result.
*Matrix multiply(double x) : Multiply scalar x by this matrix and return the result.
*Matrix divide(Matrix m) : Matrix division of this matrix on matrix m. Return the result.
*double determinant() : return the determinant of the current matrix (matrix has to be square and of size 1x1, 2x2 or 3x3)
*Matrix inverse() : return the inverse of the current matrix (matrix has to be square and of size 1x1, 2x2 or 3x3)
*boolean isSquare() : return true if the matrix is square
*Matrix transpose() : return the transpose of the current matrix
###Other###
*String toString(): to return a string representation of the matrix. 
*void print(String filename): create a file and write the matrix in it. 
*Matrix identity(int size): Static method to create an Identity square matrix of size size
